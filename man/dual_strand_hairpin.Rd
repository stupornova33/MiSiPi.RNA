}
\arguments{
\item{chrom_name}{A string corresponding to the chromosome.}

\item{reg_start}{An integer corresponding to the start of a region of interest.}

\item{reg_stop}{An integer corresponding to the end of a region of interest.}

\item{length}{The length of the chromosome of interest.}

\item{min_read_count}{A whole number. Default is 1.}

\item{genome_file}{The path to a genome fasta file.}

\item{bam_file}{The path to a BAM file. There must be a corresponding index ending in .bai in the same directory.}

\item{logfile}{The name of the file to which log information will be written.}

\item{wkdir}{The path to the directory where all outputs will be written.}

\item{plot_output}{Determines whether PDF plots will be made. Expected values are TRUE or FALSE}

\item{path_to_RNAfold}{The full path to the RNAfold binary executable.}

\item{annotate_region}{Determines whether the program will plot genomic features of interest found in the GTF annotation file. If TRUE, a GTF file must be provided as the "gtf_file" argument.}

\item{weight_reads}{Determines whether read counts will be weighted and with which method. Valid options are "weight_by_prop", "locus_norm", a user-defined value, or "none". See MiSiPi documentation for descriptions of the weighting methods.}

\item{gtf_file}{A string corresponding to the path of genome annotation in 9-column GTF format.}

\item{out_type}{The type of file to write the plots to. Options are "png" or "pdf". Default is PDF.}
